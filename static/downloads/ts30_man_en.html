<h1>1. Top Speed 3</h1>

<p>
You are reading the manual of Top Speed 3, the third version of Playing
in the Dark's racing game Top Speed. Top Speed 3 is the final release of the popular, accessible freeware racing game that uses only audio and an optional force-feedback joystick to communicate with the player. As with the prior version of Top Speed, this new version includes a multi-player mode, up to seven computer opponents to race against, and the ability to create your own tracks and vehicles. However, there are also some exciting new features, and numerous bug fixes and improvements which will be discussed in <a href="#11">section 1.1</a> of this manual.
</p>
<p>
First, we will give you a short overview of the development of this game and we describe the installation process. <a href="#12">Section 1.2</a> contains the
system requirements. <a href="#13">Section 1.3</a> describes the installation
and <a href="#14">1.4</a> the removal process.
</p>

<a id="11" name="11"></a>
<h2>1.1. What is new in Top Speed 3.0?</h2>

<p>
This section discusses the most significant new features added since Top Speed version 2.0.
</p>
<p>
<i><b>Note 1:</b> This version of Top Speed contains some changes to the way in which vehicle files are read which means that vehicle files written for earlier versions of the game are incompatible with this release. Please see <a href="#1141">section 1.1.4.1</a> below for more information. This does not apply to custom tracks written for older versions of the game, these will continue to be compatible with this release.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i><b>Note 2:</b> Be sure to also read <a href="#11101">Section 1.1.10.1</a>, as it describes a number of minor yet interesting new features and hotkeys.</i>
</p>

<a id="111" name="111"></a>
<h3>1.1.1. New tracks</h3>

<p>
Top Speed version 3.0 contains the following new tracks:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Brazil, China, Finland, France, Ireland, Portugal, Russia, Switzerland: All new race tracks, varying from easy to surprisingly tough.
</li>
<li>Rally through the desert: A long street adventure that can be quite relaxing but also quite dangerous.
</li>
<li>Rush hour: Drive through a city while the road around you is constantly being worked on, causing a not so welcome distraction.
</li>
<li>Polar escape: A lovely track with only the easiest curves. But is it as easy as it seems?
</li>
<li>Several existing street adventures have also been updated, for example to use a new surface type or a new ambient sound. See sections <a href="#1132">1.1.3.2</a> through <a href="#1135">1.1.3.5</a> for details on how to use these new features yourself.
</li>
</ul>

<a id="112" name="112"></a>
<h3>1.1.2. New vehicles</h3>

<p>
This section summarizes the new vehicles introduced with Top Speed versions 2.1 and 3.0.
</p>

<a id="1121" name="1121"></a>
<h4>1.1.2.1. The user vehicle contest</h4>

<p>
Last year Playing In The Dark asked the accessible gaming community to submit their custom vehicles, promising to include the best in the final release of the game as a built-in vehicle which could be used in all playing modes. The winning car from this contest, the Corola, is now available for everybody to play! Congratulations, Lukáš Hosnedl!
</p>

<a id="1122" name="1122"></a>
<h4>1.1.2.2. Other new vehicles</h4>

<p>
Additionally, the following new cars and motorcycles can be used:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Pickup truck</dt><dd>
The pickup truck, well known from older Dutch releases, is now back in the game.
</dd>
<dt>The classic</dt><dd>
A shiny, fast, four-geared allrounder.
</dd>
<dt>The speedy S3</dt><dd>
Another Audi, race with elegance.
</dd>
<dt>The old schoolbus</dt><dd>
This is one of the two new vehicles that utilize the new backfire parameter to create a more realistic experience (see <a href="#1143">section 1.1.4.3</a> for details).
</dd>
<dt>Chopper</dt><dd>
This new, exciting motorcycle also boasts a custom backfire sound.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Several existing vehicles have also been updated, for example to have a different brake sound.
</p>

<a id="113" name="113"></a>
<h3>1.1.3. Additions and changes to custom tracks</h3>

<p>
If you are a custom track designer, then read this section carefully to learn about the various new and changed features related to track building.
</p>
<p>
<i><b>Note:</b> As opposed to older custom vehicles, custom tracks made for Top Speed version 2.0 will still work with this new release.</i>
</p>

<a id="1131" name="1131"></a>
<h4>1.1.3.1. New syntax for track files</h4>

<p>
To make the process of creating a custom track more flexible, Top Speed version 3.0 allows writing a track's parameters in four columns as opposed to the old three-column system. A column is defined the same as in other types of tables. For example, the following row contains three values (i.e. three parts of columns):<BR />
<i>0 0 15000</i><BR />
This line defines a straight part of the road, with asphalt as the surface, for a length of 15000 units. Using the new system, you would write:<BR />
<i>0 0 0 15000</i><BR />
This will have exactly the same effect. For many tracks the old system of defining Curve, Surface and Length will suffice, although it is recommended that you use the new four-column system when writing new tracks. It is even possible to mix the two systems, but this too is not recommended. The old system may be used for extremely large track files that will be shared in multi-player mode, because the new fourth column adds to the filesize, but apart from that the new system is generally faster and allows you to define sounds more accurately.
The information stored in the first value of each row is now split between the first and the third value of that row. The new column headers could thus be named Curve, Surface, Ambient Sound and Length. In other words, the type of the curve (straight, left, hairpin left) and the noise that is to be heard during that particular part of the road (none, crowd, airplane) can now be seperately defined. Lists of curves, surfaces and ambient sounds are located in <a href="#51">our track creation tutorial</a>
</p>
<p>
The obvious benefit of this system is that you can now also play sounds in curves, whereas with the old system you could only trigger sounds on straight parts of the track. But there is more. If you specify the same ambient sound for multiple parts of the track in sequence, then the total length of these parts is calculated and the sound will play for that entire part, including correct fade-in and fade-out effects where applicable. If you need to convert a value from the first column of the old system into two values for use with the first and third columns, simply subtract 8 from the number. Notice that 8 represents the number of available curves. For example, consider the following definition:<BR />
<i>0 1 1 20000</i><BR />
<i>7 0 1 25000</i><BR />
<i>0 0 1 20000</i><BR />
<i>0 2 0 30000</i><BR />
This would start fading in the sound of a cheering crowd as soon as the player drives onto the straight part with gravel as the surface type. The sound would then reach its maximum volume in the hard right on asphalt, and from there fade out. It would stop playing as soon as the player reaches the area with water as surface type. As you can see this makes building tracks a lot more flexible. This, together with the new ambient sounds available in version 3.0, is especially useful for designing street adventures.
</p>

<a id="1132" name="1132"></a>
<h4>1.1.3.2. New surfaces</h4>

<p>
This release contains two new surfaces, sand and snow. Other surface sounds have also been optimized. Driving on sand decreases your vehicle's acceleration, meaning that it will take longer to get to full speed. The advantage, however, is that your deceleration is also considerably increased, allowing you to come to a full stop in less time.
When driving on snow it's your steering that you should be watching. Due to an increased sensitivity of your vehicle's steering wheel even the easy turns can become difficult to take, especially at higher speeds.
</p>

<a id="1133" name="1133"></a>
<h4>1.1.3.3. New sounds</h4>

<p>
Top Speed version 3.0 contains a variety of new sounds for track designers, both oneshots (sounds that only play once, like an airplane flying by) and backgrounds (sounds that are constantly playing, like a massive crowd).
</p>

<a id="1134" name="1134"></a>
<h4>1.1.3.4. New ambiences</h4>

<p>
Top Speed version 3.0 also includes a number of new ambiences, sounds that play as long as a race is active. To define such a sound, end your track definition as follows:<BR />
<i>-1 0 2</i><BR />
Where the <i>2</i> can be any valid ambience. Keep in mind that you have to define the track's weather before defining an ambience, otherwise the game will interpret the number you specify as a weather sound (see <a href="#1135">the next section, 1.1.3.5</a>).
</p>

<a id="1135" name="1135"></a>
<h4>1.1.3.5. New weather types</h4>

<p>
Finally, version 3.0 of Top Speed contains some new weather types. These are similar to the ambiences described in the previous section. The advantage of being able to define them seperately is that you can combine two background sounds, one ambience and one weather sound. Specify the weather type just below the <i>-1</i>, like this:<BR />
<i>-1 1</i>
</p>

<a id="114" name="114"></a>
<h3>1.1.4. Additions and changes to custom vehicles</h3>

<p>
This section describes the new and incompatible syntax for vehicle files, additional parameters and the concept of using backfire sounds.
</p>

<a id="1141" name="1141"></a>
<h4>1.1.4.1. New syntax for vehicle files</h4>

<p>
The new syntax for vehicle files is actually not all that different from the current one. All parameters that could be used for version 2.0 remain the same, but instead of specifying <i>car1</i> or <i>cycle2</i> to refer to a built-in sound, you should now write lines such as:<BR />
<i>enginesound=builtin1</i><BR />
<i>startsound=builtin11</i><BR />
The value <i>builtin1</i> represents the old <i>car1</i>, <i>builtin2</i> is <i>car2</i>, and so on up to the last car (which is <i>builtin9</i> right now). To reference what used to be <i>cycle1</i> you have to specify <i>builtin10</i>. The third motorcycle, which was added in this release, is represented with <i>builtin12</i>. Furthermore, some cars will have different numbers than in version 2.0. For example, specifying <i>car4</i>, in fact <i>builtin4</i>, will have a different effect in this version. To find the right number for the vehicle you want, simply count the items of any vehicle selection menu in the game, or review the vehicles folder which you can find in the sounds folder of your favorite language pack.
</p>

<a id="1142" name="1142"></a>
<h4>1.1.4.2. New parameters</h4>

<p>
The following new parameters can be used when writing vehicle files:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>backfiresound </dt><dd>
see <a href="#1143">section 1.1.4.3</a> below
</dd>
<dt>crashsound </dt><dd>
specify a custom crash sound
</dd>
<dt>brakesound </dt><dd>
specify a custom brake sound
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
You can either use <i>builtin1</i> through <i>builtin12</i> for these parameters, or you can specify a sound file of your own. These sound files should still be in the PCM wave-format (*.wav). If you do not provide values for these parameters, the default values will be used. These are usually the sounds used for the first vehicle available, currently the Blackbird racecar.
</p>

<a id="1143" name="1143"></a>
<h4>1.1.4.3. Backfire</h4>

<p>
The backfire sound is played occasionally when switching gears (up or down) and when you release the throttle. This can make certain types of vehicles, such as trucks and motorcycles, sound a great deal more authentic. Two examples of how to use this new feature are included in the game in the form of the Old schoolbus and the Chopper.
To define a custom backfire sound, simply use the <i>backfiresound</i> parameter in your vehicle file. Please note that although you can specify <i>builtin1</i> as a value for this setting, the player will not hear any backfire sound for that vehicle as it does not have one. If you want to make use of the game's built-in sounds for backfiring, use <i>builtin9</i> (the Old schoolbus) or <i>builtin12</i> (the Chopper).
</p>

<a id="115" name="115"></a>
<h3>1.1.5. New language and soundpack features</h3>

<p>
Top Speed version 3.0 boasts a number of enhancements for soundpack creators that this section will discuss.
</p>

<a id="1151" name="1151"></a>
<h4>1.1.5.1. Switching languages</h4>

<p>
Another great new feature introduced in this release is the capability to instantly switch from one language pack to another, i.e. without restarting the game. This may also be useful for changing soundpacks in the same language. To change your language or soundpack, go to Options and choose Game Settings-&gt;Language. To add your own item to this selection menu, add a folder with the name of your pack to the Sounds folder found in the Top Speed installation directory. Next, add a file encoded in Ogg Vorbis and with the same name as your pack to the Sounds directory. For example, for the original English language pack there is a folder Sounds\En and a file Sounds\En.ogg. Also remember that your entire language pack should be encoded as Ogg Vorbis.
</p>

<a id="1152" name="1152"></a>
<h4>1.1.5.2. New folder structure</h4>

<p>
All sounds used in Top Speed 3.0 are now located in separate subfolders. It is recommended to use the original English language pack as an example, if you are going to create a new pack.
</p>

<a id="1153" name="1153"></a>
<h4>1.1.5.3. Providing more variation in soundpacks</h4>

<p>
To give the player more variation during the race it is now possible to provide multiple sound files for certain actions, for example the co-pilot announcements. Those are all the curve and surface announcement messages. The game will play a randomly selected sound file every time such an announcement is made. To use this new facility, simply create multiple files, giving each of them an index number starting at 1. For example, <i>left1.ogg</i>, <i>left2.ogg</i> and <i>left3.ogg</i>, or <i>snow1.ogg</i> to <i>snow12.ogg</i>. Other possibilities are <i>finish*.ogg</i>, <i>front*.ogg</i> and <i>tail*.ogg</i>. The maximum number of sounds per announcement is 32. As a consequence, even if you only want to put one sound file in your soundpack for a given announcement, you should include a number in the filename, e.g. <i>hairpinleft1.ogg</i>.
</p>

<a id="116" name="116"></a>
<h3>1.1.6. Improved installer</h3>

<p>
Top Speed version 3.0 uses an improved version of the original setup program that allows you to make more detailed adjustments to what is installed on your computer. You can now choose whether or not to install the ReadMe and/or the English language pack. You can also choose not to install the main program. This is useful, for example, when you want to restore the official language files after installing a third party pack. Fully completed and high-quality soundpacks for other languages may also be included if they become available.
</p>

<a id="117" name="117"></a>
<h3>1.1.7. New hotkeys</h3>

<p>
Regardless of whether you are playing in Time Trial, Single Race or multi-player mode, Top Speed now has the ability to provide you with useful race information through a few simple, easy to remember hotkeys. These hotkeys are listed below. We will go more into detail in <a href="#62">section 6.2</a> about what they do exactly.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>F1 through F8</dt><dd>
player vehicle information
</dd>
<dt>F9</dt><dd>
Current track
</dd>
<dt>F12</dt><dd>
Pause / unpause
</dd>
<dt>Q </dt><dd>
current gear
</dd>
<dt>W </dt><dd>
current lap number
</dd>
<dt>E</dt><dd>
current race percentage
</dd>
<dt>R</dt><dd>
current lap percentage
</dd>
<dt>T</dt><dd>
current race time
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Notice that these hotkeys (F1-F12 and Q, W, E, R and T) are placed next to each other on the keyboard for easy access. If you wish, however, you can reassign these in the Options-&gt;Controls menu, accessed from the Main Menu. The only keys you cannot change are the F-keys, F1 through F12.
</p>

<a id="118" name="118"></a>
<h3>1.1.8. New settings</h3>

<p>
Here is a list of new settings in Top Speed version 3.0. You can find a brief description of what they do in <a href="#227">section 2.2.7</a>, along with the other, old options.
</p>

<h3>1.1.9. Screen reader additions</h3>

<p>
If you are using a screenreader (which is very likely), you might be used to disabling it before starting Top Speed. Starting from version 3, we have included support in the installer which allows you to leave your screenreader on while playing.
</p>

<a id="1191" name="1191"></a>
<h4>1.1.9.1. JAWS</h4>

<p>
If you are using JAWS for Windows and do not disable it when playing Top Speed, life gets quite unpleasant. This is why we added a JAWS configuration file to our installer, which puts JAWS in sleep mode and makes it possible to leave it enabled.
</p>
<p>
To enable this functionality, navigate to the Top Speed 3 installation folder, and open the folder <i>Scripts</i>. You will find a file called <i>TopSpeed.jcf</i>. Now go to the Start menu, select <i>(All) Programs</i> and find the <i>Explore Jaws</i> folder in the menu of your preferred JAWS version. Choose <i>Explore my settings</i>. A new instance of the Windows Explorer will appear, showing you your JAWS settings folder. You are done as soon as you have copied the <i>TopSpeed.jcf</i> file from the Top Speed Scripts folder to your JAWS settings folder. You can now leave JAWS on while playing.
</p>

<a id="1192" name="1192"></a>
<h4>1.1.9.2. Other screenreaders</h4>

<p>
If you use another screenreader like Window-Eyes, NVDA or Dolphin SuperNova, things are a lot easier. You can just leave your screenreader on, however you might want to disable your speech synthesizer.
</p>

<a id="1110" name="1110"></a>

<h2>1.2. System requirements</h2>

<p>
The system requirements for Top Speed 3 are very low. The basics of the game will work
on almost any pc running Windows 2000 or newer with DirectX 8.1 or newer
installed. This also includes 64-bit systems. Windows 98Se and Windows ME should work as well, but has not officially been tested. If your computer is running Windows XP or newer, DirectX 8.1 is installed by default. Should you need DirectX, you can download version 8.1 or preferably version 9.0C for free from the Microsoft website at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">http://www.microsoft.com/directx</a> . Furthermore your computer must be
equipped with a stereo soundcard and a headset or stereo speakers.
</p>
<p>
<i><b>Note:</b> In windows Vista or newer, some alterations made to 3d-sound may affect the positioning of network and computer players. Unfortunately, we have not been able to fix this. See <a href="#8">section 8</a> for more information.</i>
</p>

<a id="13" name="13"></a>
<h2>1.3. Installing the program</h2>

<p>
If you wish to install Top Speed 3, then open the file you downloaded
from <a href="http://www.playinginthedark.net/">the Playing in the Dark website</a>. A welcome screen appears. Click
<i>Next</i>. On the next screen you can alter the install path or you can use
the default path. If you agree with the destination, click <i>next</i>. The
next screen shows the components to install. If you agree with a full
installation, just click <i>next</i>. To install Top Speed 3 without the
English language pack, select <i>Core only</i>. Otherwise, set the
installation type to <i>custom</i> and select the components manually. The
next screen asks you for changes that will be made to the start-menu.
If you agree with the default settings, click <i>next</i>. The following
screen shows you the option to create a desktop icon, and the final
screen shows the settings you chose. When you agree with these, click
<i>Install</i> and the game will be installed. Once the installation is
finished you can start the game, and you can read this manual by
clicking on a checkbox if you like. Otherwise select <i>Finish</i> and the
installation is completed.
</p>

<a id="14" name="14"></a>
<h2>1.4. Removing the program</h2>

<p>
It's really simple to remove Top Speed 3, but we'll explain it anyway.
Go to the Windows Start menu, Programs, Playing in the Dark, Top Speed
3. Select <i>Uninstall Top Speed</i> and follow the instructions. If you want to make sure everything is removed after the process, remove the <i>Playing in the Dark</i> folder from <i>c:\Program Files</i>.
</p>

<a id="15" name="15"></a>
<h2>1.5. Installing new Vehicles and tracks</h2>

<p>
Top Speed 3 comes with a feature that allows you to install new Vehicles and
tracks downloaded from the internet, with a maximum of 64 each.
</p>
<p>
Vehicles will consist of a number of sound files and a <i>.vhc</i> file.
To add a vehicle to the game, copy these files to the <i>vehicles</i> folder
within the installation folder of Top Speed 3. The next time you play
the game, the new vehicle will automatically appear in the list of available
vehicles. Note that, however they will show up in the list, vehicles made for Top Speed 2 won't be compatible with Top Speed 3. Choosing one of those vehicles will probably cause a program faillure. 
</p>
<p>
A track consists of a sound file and a <i>.trk</i> file. To install
a downloaded track, copy these 2 files to the <i>Tracks</i> folder. The new
track will be added to the list of available tracks automatically. Unlike with vehicles, tracks made for Top Speed 2 should be compatible with version 3.
</p>

<a id="2" name="2"></a>
<h1>2. Playing the game</h1>

<p>
This section contains information on how to play Top Speed 3.
</p>

<a id="21" name="21"></a>
<h2>2.1. Driving</h2>

<p>
As in any racing game, the goal of the game is to complete a track or a
number of laps as fast as possible without crashing. In this game you
can't see the road, but you can hear it. When playing the game, you'll
hear the sound of your engine through your speakers. When you are driving
neatly in the middle of the road, the sound will be coming from both
speakers. If you drift to one side of the road, the source of the engine
sound will shift to one side as well. If you drift too much, you will end
up crashing your car. But of course you can count on your co-pilot to
tell you what lies ahead, at least when he's paying attention and you didn't leave him  behind. 
</p>

<a id="22" name="22"></a>
<h2>2.2. The menu</h2>

<p>
Top Speed 3 has an elaborate menu with dozens of options to choose from.
We will go over the most important ones in this section.
</p>

<a id="221" name="221"></a>
<h3>2.2.1. Navigating the menu</h3>

<p>
Navigating the Top Speed menu is simple. Use the up and down or left and
right arrows to browse through the options and press the enter key to
select one. You can also use a joystick or steering wheel. You can go up
a level of the menu by selecting the <i>Go back</i> option or use the escape
or the backspace key.
</p>

<a id="222" name="222"></a>
<h3>2.2.2. Quick start</h3>

<p>
This option is a real quickstart. It will put you on a random track
immediately in a random vehicle. you will be driving a number of laps
against a number of computer opponents. The number of laps and the
number of computer players depend on the options you have selected from
the options menu, but by default you will drive 3 laps against 3 other
players.
</p>

<a id="223" name="223"></a>
<h3>2.2.3. Time trial</h3>

<p>
In time trial mode, you will race against the clock. No opponents, it is
just you, your team, your vehicle and the road. Try to beat your own fastest time on a
circuit, street adventure or even a custom track. This is also a great
mode to practise driving and to get to know the different tracks and Vehicles.
</p>

<a id="224" name="224"></a>
<h3>2.2.4. Single race</h3>

<p>
The single race mode puts a number of computer opponents with you on the
track. The target is to beat them and to cross the finish line first.
You can choose for normal race tracks and street adventures, the same as
in time trial mode. You can change the difficulty and the number of
opponents in the options menu.
</p>

<a id="225" name="225"></a>
<h3>2.2.5. Street adventures</h3>

<p>
Street adventures offer a little bit more action then the regular race
tracks. They feature different kind of road surfaces. The road is
narrower and contains more curves. You can choose them in time trial or
single race mode. Street adventures are always one lap.
</p>

<a id="226" name="226"></a>
<h3>2.2.6. Multi-player game</h3>

<p>
Via the multi-player game menu, you can connect to other players over a
local network or over the internet to race against each other. The
gameplay itself is identical to the single race mode except now it is
your own friends that push you off the road! We will go further into how
to set up a multi-player game in <a href="#3">chapter 3</a>.
</p>

<a id="227" name="227"></a>
<h3>2.2.7. Options</h3>

<p>
The options menu contains a number of items that let you personalize the
gameplay of the game. The options menu has a number of submenu's:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Game settings</dt><dd>
contains settings concerning the gameplay in general.
  <dl>
  <dt>Language</dt><dd>

contains settings configuring how your vehicle is controlled
</dd>
<dt> Select device</dt><dd>
allows you to choose whether you control your car
 with the keyboard or with a joystick or steering wheel.
  <dl>
  <dt>Force Feedback </dt><dd>
Force feedback is a technology that lets you <i>feel</i> a game. If your joystick or steering wheel is equipped with
 it, you will feel the gravel beneath your tires or be shaken up
 whenever you crash. In this menu you can turn it on or off (if
 available)
  </dd>
  <dt>Assign keyboard controls</dt><dd>
selecting this option will lead you

  </dl>
</dd>
<dt>Race settings</dt><dd>
contains settings concerning the gameplay during races.
  <dl>
  <dt>Co-pilot</dt><dd>
changing this option influences what will be announced
 by the co-pilot. With the <i>all</i> option selected, the co-pilot will
 announce both curves as well as road surfaces.
  </dd>
  <dt>Curve announcement</dt><dd>
there are two options here: with //fixed
 distance before the curve// selected, the co-pilot will announce a
 curve always at the same distance before the actual curve. With
 the  <i>speed dependant</i> option selected, the co-pilot with take the
 current speed of the vehicle in consideration and announce sooner if
 you are going faster.
  </dd>
  <dt>Automatic race information</dt><dd>
when racing against other players, the race announcer will give you information about your position.
 You can always ask for this information by pressing the assigned
 key, or with this option selected it will be given to you
 periodically. If you select <i>Laps Only</i>, only lap announcements will be given, meaning that also the lap announcements will be disabled if you disable automatic race information entirely.
  </dd>
  <dt>Number of laps</dt><dd>
Allows you to choose the desired number of laps for tracks that are not marked as street adventure.
:Number Of Computer Players
Here you can select anywhere from 1 up to 7 computer players for the single race mode. This does not affect the difficulty level as it did in prior versions.
  </dd>
  <dt>Difficulty</dt><dd>
sets the difficulty level used in single race mode. There are 3 levels to choose from. <i>Easy</i> will give you computer opponents which are not very skilled. <i>Normal</i> will give you opponents that are pretty good at driving a car. The <i>hard</i> option
 provides a real challenge. There are now drivers that are hard to beat on the track.
  </dd>
  </dl>
</dd>
<dt>Restore default settings</dt><dd>
when you have fiddled with the settings
 too much, you can always select this option. After asking for a comfirmation, it will restore all
 settings back to the default ones from when you have just installed
 the game. It will not delete your highscores, only the options
 from the options menu.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>2.2.8. Exit game</h3>

<p>
The title says it all. This will fade out the music and exit the game.
</p>

<a id="3" name="3"></a>
<h1>3. Multi-player</h1>

<p>
Starting from Top Speed 2, this game contains an exciting multi-player mode, which this section explains.
</p>

<a id="31" name="31"></a>
<h2>3.1. On a local network</h2>

<p>
If all players are on a local network, things are pretty simple. One
person will have to be the server. This preferably is the one with the
most powerful computer, and more important, a fast connection to the network, preferably an ethernet one. This person selects the option <i>host a game on your own server</i> and continues to select a tracktype and so on. Once the server has
started, all other players select <i>join a game on the local network</i> from the
multi-player menu. The game will then search for servers on the local
network. After about five seconds the game returns with a list of all
found servers on the local network. Each server is identified by a 4
digit number. This number is given to you when you start the game for the first time, or restore the default settings, and allows players to identify a server as yours. Most of the time only one server is found and choosing is easy. When all players have joined
and selected their favourite car, the server needs to press the <i>enter</i>
key (or button 1 on the joystick) to start the countdown to the start.
</p>

<a id="32" name="32"></a>
<h2>3.2. Playing over the internet</h2>

<p>
Over the internet things get a little more complicated. Unfortunately,
depending on the setup of your network, internet play is not always
possible. Here we will explain a number of steps to achieve the highest
possibility of success.
</p>

<a id="321" name="321"></a>
<h3>3.2.1. Step 1: deciding who will start a server and who will join</h3>

<p>
Not everyone has the ability to start a server that can be reached over
the internet. The highest probability of success is to start a server
that is connected to the internet directly and not through a router. To
check whether you are behind a router you need to check your IP address.
An IP address is an address containing 4 numbers that identify your
computer on a network or even the entire internet. You can read your IP
address using the <i>Top Speed 3 Configuration Tool</i> found in the <i>tools</i> folder of
the Top Speed 3 folder in the start menu. The configuration tool is a piece of software that will let you configure to which internet server you want to
connect, as well as an option which allows the developers to debug the game, <i>Enable tracing</i>. It is highly recommended that you leave tracing disabled unless you're asked to provide a trace log containing debug information. The tool will also tell you your IP address. If the IP address starts
with <i>192.168</i> or with <i>10.0.0</i> then you are behind a router. It is
likely that other players will not be able to connect to your server
should you start one. Let someone that is not behind a router start a
Top Speed 3 server.
</p>

<a id="322" name="322"></a>
<h3>3.2.2. Step 2: Configuring which server to connect to</h3>

<p>
Once you have decided who will start a server, this person has to give
his IP address to the rest of the players. He can do this by using the
<i>Copy IP to clipboard</i> button in the server selector tool and pasting it
in messages to the other players. All other players then have to fill in
this IP address in the textbox of the Server Selector tool found in the
start menu.
</p>

<a id="323" name="323"></a>
<h3>3.2.3. Step 3: Starting the game</h3>

<p>
After all players have filled in the IP address of the server in the
textbox of the server selector tool and pressed the OK button, you are
ready to start the game. The person selected to start the server selects
<i>host a game on your own server</i>. Once the server has started, all other players can
select <i>join a game on the internet</i> in the multi-player menu. When all players
have joined and selected their favourite car, the server needs to press
the <i>enter</i> key (or button 1 on the joystick) to start the countdown to
the start.
</p>

<a id="324" name="324"></a>
<h3>3.2.4. Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>
This section contains some tips you can try when you are unable to
connect over the internet.
Turn off firewall software. Windows XP service pack 2 or higher contains
an embedded firewall that might prevent other players from connecting to
your server. You might even have other firewall software installed. If
you are having problems letting other players connect to your server, try
turning it off or configure Top Speed 3 as an exception. Do not forget to
re-enable it when you are done playing.
When you are behind a router there is still chance you can host a game.
If your router supports the uPnP protocol it will allow you to start a
server in the normal way. However, players who want to connect need to
enter the IP address of your router instead of that of your computer.
The easiest way to find out your routers' IP address is to surf to
<a href="http://www.whatismyip.org">http://www.whatismyip.org</a>. If you are an
advanced user and know how to configure your router, you can let port
25255 (both UDP and TCP) pass through to your computer.

<h1>4. Frequently asked questions</h1>

<p>
To know how to get in touch with us, <a href="#44">quickly jump to section 4.4</a>.
</p>

<a id="41" name="41"></a>
<h2>4.1. Why can't I use the extra Vehicles in multi-player?</h2>

<p>
Since extra Vehicles can be as powerful as you like them to be by editing
them yourself, it would be very easy to cheat in multi-player races. You
could build your own super vehicle and win every race. Another problem is,
extra Vehicles in multi-player would be hard to do since it is not guaranteed
that every player has these Vehicles installed.
</p>

<a id="42" name="42"></a>
<h2>4.2. Can you give some driving tips?</h2>

<p>
Some basic rules apply to driving a vehicle in Top Speed 3. These are the
same rules as with a real life vehicle:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The faster you drive, the less manoeuvrable your vehicle becomes. So brake
before hard turns!
</li>
<li>While you are braking hard, the vehicle loses grip and you can't turn fast.
So: brake before the curves and release the brakes during the curve itself.
</li>
<li>The vehicle loses manoeuvrability on gravel, sand and snow, or while driving
through water: your vehicle will loose grip in turns and will accelerate
and decelerate less, only on sand you will decelerate very fast.
</li>
<li>When you are using manual transmission, try not to let the engine rev up
too high or too low. You will loose power. Theoretically, you can
accelerate a little faster with manual than with automatic transmission.
</li>
<li>Driving of the road at slow speeds only lets you bump a bit. It will
cost you less time than a full speed crash.
</li>
<li>Try to memorize the tracks, it will allow you to anticipate the next
curve faster than your co-pilot announces it.
</li>
<li>Drive right in front of your opponents so they cannot pass.
</li>
<li>If you want to get better in multi-player games, use the time trial mode to practise your skills.
</li>
</ol>

<a id="43" name="43"></a>
<h2>4.3. I have found an error in the game, what now?</h2>

<p>
Top Speed 3 has been tested extensively during its development. But we
are only human and there are lots of differences in computer hardware
that might influence the performance of the game. If you have encountered
an error in the game, you can report it to us and maybe we can provide a
fix in later releases. When you send us an error report, please specify
the nature of the error and in what circumstances it happens. Also,
please include your Windows and DirectX version. Every time you play the
game, a file called <i>TopSpeed.trc</i> is generated in the installation
folder. This file contains information that might help us track down
errors. Please attach this file to any error report you send us. Since
this file is overwritten every time you start the game, be sure to make
a copy of it before restarting the game or simply send it to us right
after finding the error. You can send error reports to info at
playinginthedark dot net.
</p>

<a id="44" name="44"></a>

<h2>5.1. Creating your own tracks</h2>

<p>
This tutorial describes how to build your own tracks for use with Top Speed 3. though tracks made for Top Speed 2 are still accessible in version 3, instructions on how to convert a Top Speed 2 track to the new syntax are written down in <a href="#1131">section 1.1.3.1</a>.
</p>
<p>
All you need is notepad and a microphone to record the soundfile describing your track in the menu.
</p>
<p>
You need to create a textfile with the extension <i>.trk</i>. Look at the <i>zandvoort.trk</i> track for an example.    
</p>
<p>
The file contains four columns of numbers. Each line of four numbers describes part of the track. A part consists of:
</p>
<p>
The type of curve:
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<td>Straight</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Easy left</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Left</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hard left</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hairpin left</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Easy right</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Right</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hard right</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hairpin right</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The surfacetype:
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<td>Asphalt</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gravel</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Water</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sand</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Snow</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
An optional sound to be played:
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<td>No sound</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Crowd</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ocean</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Propeller plane</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Church clock</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jetplane</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thunder</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pile drivers</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Construction</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>River</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Helicopter</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Owl</td>
<td>11</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The length of that particular part of the track, the minimum length is 5000. The number doesn't have a unit, but you could say that it is more or less in centimeters.
</p>
<p>
The last line of a track file could look as follows:<BR />
<i>-1 1 2</i><BR />
The -1 indicates the end of the track. The other two numbers represent the type of water and the ambience of the track. These are both sounds which are played during the whole race. You can choose between the following weather types:
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<td>No sound (sunny)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rain</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wind</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Storm</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The following ambiences are available:
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<td>None</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Desert</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Airport</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The filename needs to end on <i>.trk</i> and needs to be placed in the <i>Tracks</i> folder of the game. Next, you need a wave file with the same name as the track containing the sound to be played in the menu. So if your trackfile is called <i>mytrack.trk</i>, you also need to have a <i>mytrack.wav</i> file in the Tracks folder.
</p>
<p>
If the filename starts with <i>adv</i>, it indicates a street adventure. Happy track making!

<h2>5.2. Creating your own vehicles</h2>

<p>
This tutorial describes how to build your own vehicles for use with Top Speed 3. Instructions on how to convert a Top Speed 2 vehicle to the new syntax are written down in <a href="#1141">section 1.1.4.1</a>.
</p>
<p>
All you need is notepad and a microphone to record the soundfile describing your vehicle in the menu. You can use your own soundfiles for the different sounds of the vehicle, but you can also use the ones already included in the game.
</p>
<p>
You need to create a textfile with the extension <i>.vhc</i>.
Look at the <i>streetracer.vhc</i> file for an example.    
</p>
<p>
 The file contains several variables describing your vehicle. Here's for example the description of the Chopper:<BR />
<i>enginesound=builtin12</i><BR />
<i>throttlesound=builtin12</i><BR />
<i>startsound=builtin12</i><BR />
<i>hornsound=builtin12</i><BR />
<i>backfiresound=builtin12</i><BR />
<i>crashsound=builtin12</i><BR />
<i>brakesound=builtin12</i><BR />
<i>acceleration=13</i><BR />
<i>deceleration=45</i><BR />
<i>topspeed=24000</i><BR />
<i>idlefreq=22050</i><BR />
<i>topfreq=27550</i><BR />
<i>shiftfreq=23550</i><BR />
<i>numberofgears=5</i><BR />
<i>steering=150</i><BR />
<i>steeringfactor=66</i><BR />
<i>haswipers=0</i>
</p>
<p>
<i><b>Warning:</b> spaces and capital letters are important in this file, so the easiest and safest way to create a vehicle is to start from an existing file.</i> We will go over each variable:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The first variable is <i>enginesound</i>. It describes the standard engine sound. The value of this variable can be any wave file you place in the vehicles folder. If you want to use e.g. the file <i>engine.wav</i> as a loopsound for the engine, this line will read:<BR />
<i>enginesound=engine.wav</i><BR />
Make sure your sound sounds good in a loop to get the best result.
If you want to use a sound included in the game, you can use <i>builtin1</i> through <i>builtin12</i>. To find the right number for the vehicle you want, simply count the items of any vehicle selection menu in the game, or review the vehicles folder which you can find in the sounds folder of your favorite language pack.
</li>
<li>The next variable is <i>throttlesound</i>. This is a sound that is used when the user presses the throttle to give the engine sound that extra punch. It must also be a looping sound. In the game, not every vehicle has a throttle sound defined. You can choose between <i>builtin1</i>, <i>builtin2</i>, <i>builtin9</i> and <i>builtin12</i>. Choosing one of the other vehicles will use the throttlesound definition of that particular vehicle, meaning that it won't use a throttle sound at all, since it does not have one defined.
</li>
<li>The variable <i>startsound</i> describes the sound for starting your vehicle. All the vehicles in the game have a start sound, so this should not be a problem. Note that some vehicles will share their start sound though.
</li>
<li>The variable <i>hornsound</i> describes the sound that is used for the vehicle's horn. It must be a looping sound. If you have read the instructions above, this should all be self-explanatory.
</li>
<li>The variable <i>backfiresound</i> describes the sound that is used for backfiring, which is played occasionally when switching gears (up or down) and when you release the throttle. If you want to make use of the game's built-in sounds for backfiring, use <i>builtin9</i> or <i>builtin12</i>. More information about backfiring is located in <a href="#1143">section 1.1.4.3</a>.
</li>
<li>The variable <i>crashsound</i> describes the sound which is played when the vehicle crashes.
</li>
<li>The variable <i>brakesound</i> describes a looping sound which is played when the vehicle brakes on asphalt.
</li>
<li>The variable <i>acceleration</i> describes how fast the vehicle can accelerate. In most situations, changing it a bit up and down and trying things out is the best way to achieve the best result.
</li>
<li>The variable <i>deceleration</i> describes how well the brakes of your vehicle work.
</li>
<li>The variable <i>topspeed</i> describes the maximum speed of your vehicle. To give you an idea, the top speed of the blackbird racecar is 17500. The top speed of the contestant is 23000.
</li>
<li>The next three variables are used to play the engine sounds correctly, play with the values until your vehicle sounds right:
  <dl>
  <dt>idlefreq</dt><dd>
the frequency at which the enginesound plays when vehicle idles, probably equal to the bitrate of your file
  </dd>
  <dt>topfreq</dt><dd>
the frequency at which the enginesound is played when the vehicle reaches maximum speed. This variable should be higher then the idle frequency. A good starting point is double the value of the idle frequency
  </dd>
  <dt>shiftfreq</dt><dd>
should be in between the idle frequency and the top frequency. This is the frequency the engine begins after a gear switch
  </dd>
  </dl>
</li>
<li>The variable <i>numberofgears</i> describes the... well... the number of gears.
</li>
<li>The variable <i>steering</i> describes how well the vehicle steers.
</li>
<li>The variable <i>steeringfactor</i> describes how much the steering capability diminishes when speed increases, or to put it simple: how well you vehicle behaves at high speeds. This is put in percentages so it should be a value between 1 and 100. A value of 100 indicates the car steers just as well at topspeed as when going slow.
</li>
<li>The variable <i>haswipers</i> says whether or not your vehicle has got windshieldwipers to use when it rains. A value of <i>1</i> says it does have wipers, a value of <i>0</i> says it doesn't.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Just like with a track, you need to create a <i>.wav</i>-file containing a sound describing your vehicle that will be used in the game menu. It has to be named exactly like the <i>.vhc</i>-file.
</p>
<p>
That's it. You can leave variables out of the file and the game will use defaults.

<h1>7. Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>
First of all, we'd like to say a few words about the development of Top Speed. Most importantly, we'd like to thank  all our users for their continued support, suggestions and ideas. It should be obvious that a game without players  isn't much of a game at all. Secondly, we are happy to introduce our PayPal donate button! By making a donation you  can assure us, the developers, that those years of hard work, all in our own time, were worth it, and that there may  even be room for a future release of Top Speed 3 that would add even more of the most requested features. However,  remember that Top Speed is and always will be a free game. You will never be required to pay in order to play the  full game, although we'd be lying if we said donations aren't welcome. Please <a href="http://www.PlayingInTheDark.net">go to our website</a> and  visit the donate page to find out more and, if you'd like, make a donation.

<h2>7.1. The Playing in the Dark team</h2>

<p>
The Playing in the Dark team is Pieter de Ruijter, Bram Duvigneau, Leonard de Ruijter and Davy Loots. There is no strict task separation but in
general:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Pieter delivers lots of sounds and is the holder of most of the vehicles
in the game.
</li>
<li>Bram takes care of <a href="http://www.playinginthedark.net/">the Playing in the Dark website</a> and supports the
programmers with help and advice.
</li>
<li>Davy programmed the base of Top Speed 3. Due to a lack of time, he had
to decrease his programming work. Nowadays, he offers the programmers
assistance and writes small amounts of code.
</li>
<li>Leonard writes the installers and joined the programmers team after the
release of Top Speed 2.0
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of these people work on Top Speed 3 in their spare time despite each
having a busy and full schedule. They receive no physical reward for
their work and distribute their work for free. Please keep that in mind
when casting judgement on the game and it is creators.
</p>

<a id="72" name="72"></a>
<h2>7.2. Ruby Accessware</h2>

<p>
For more information about Ruby Accessware, feel free to <a href="http://www.rubyaccess.com/">visit their website</a>!
</p>

<a id="73" name="73"></a>
<h2>7.3. Third party assistance</h2>

<p>
We would also like to thank the following people for the work they did on Top Speed 3:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Arjan Tool, who delivered us great work on creating some of the harder street adventures
</li>
<li>Rosalin Morales, who is responsible for the menu voice in Top Speed 3
</li>
<li>Derek Lane, who is the legendary co-pilot in Top Speed 3
</li>
<li>Patrick Perdue, who took his radio receiver and transmitter to create a very realistic part in the automatic race information
</li>
<li>Andre Louis, who is mainly responsible for our menu theme
</li>
</ul>

<a id="74" name="74"></a>
<h2>7.4. Betatesters</h2>

<p>
If Top Speed 3 reaches a high quality standard, it is because it has been
thoroughly tested before its releases. Months before the release of
version 2, an international group of betatesters started testing
betaversion after betaversion. The bugs they found and improvements they
suggested are numerous and therefore we would like to thank them. In
random order they are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Joseph Weakland
</li>
<li>Daniel Heimrath
</li>
<li>Simon Eigeldinger
</li>
<li>Shane Davidson
</li>
<li>Melanie van Egmond
</li>
<li>Marko Molenaar
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We'd like to thank Arjan Tool for the intensive testing of Top Speed 3
before its release. Also a thank you for the creators of several language packs.

<h1>8. Known Issues</h1>

<p>
The following is a list of issues that are known to the developers but that have not been resolved in this release, for a variety of reasons. Please do not report these problems again unless you have additional information that could help to fix them.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Under Windows Vista and newer, Top Speed's 3D-audio doesn't sound as clearly as on older versions of Windows. This is a problem with DirectSound, not with the game.
</li>
<li>Inspite of the recent changes to Top Speed's multi-player mode, you may still find that network performance isn't always optimal. This is because of various problems, including the network API that Top Speed uses and the way in which the game has been designed.
</li>
<li>On Windows XP and older, Top Speed may encounter an error while racing if the installed version of DirectX is not up-to-date. Performance on newer versions of Windows may also not be optimal when using an older version of DirectX. It is therefore recommended for all users to use the DirectX Web Installer to make sure the latest version is installed. You can <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3&amp;displaylang=en">download it here</a>.
