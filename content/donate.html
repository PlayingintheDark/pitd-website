<p> <b><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">
    We'd like to thank  all our users for their continued support, suggestions and ideas. It should be obvious that a game without players  isn't much of a game at all.<br />We are happy to introduce our PayPal donate button! By making a donation you  can assure us, the developers, that those years of hard work, all in our own time, were worth it. However,  remember that Top Speed is and always will be a free game. You will never be required to pay in order to play the  full game, although we'd be lying if we said donations aren't welcome. Also, please keep in mind that the current version of Top Speed 3 is the final version of the project.<br /><br />
